He stayed with his family of four people, his father - Pan Singh, his mother - Devaki Dev, and his elder sister in the city of Ranchi, Jharkhand.

But all of this has a side story where he practices with his school’s coach for bowl catching regularly. He studied in a school named DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School located in Ranchi itself. By a couple of months, he became an excellent goalkeeper in his football team. This skill turned him into an excellent wicket keeper in cricket.
